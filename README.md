# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project develops a robust time series forecasting model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence prediction. The goal is to accurately forecast a future trend based on historical data. This project goes beyond a basic implementation by incorporating data preprocessing and feature engineering, which are crucial for real-world time series problems.

### ðŸ’¾ Dataset

The model is trained on a synthetic time series dataset representing a typical financial or economic trend. The data is generated programmatically within the notebook to simulate a clear trend, seasonality, and noise. The code is structured to easily handle additional features for more complex, real-world forecasting tasks.

### ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

1.  **Data Generation and Preprocessing:** A synthetic time series dataset is created to simulate a realistic trend. The data is then normalized using a `MinMaxScaler` to improve model stability and performance.

2.  **Feature Engineering:** The time series is transformed into a supervised learning problem by creating sequences of past data points (e.g., using the last 50 points) to predict the next future value.

3.  **LSTM Model Architecture:** A sequential model with two stacked LSTM layers and Dropout for regularization is designed to learn from the sequential data. The model is compiled with an `Adam` optimizer and a `mean_squared_error` loss function.

4.  **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on the first 80% of the sequence data and its performance is evaluated on the remaining 20% as a test set. The predictions are visualized against the actual data to assess the model's accuracy.

### ðŸ“Š Concluded Results

The LSTM model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, accurately capturing the underlying trends and patterns in the time series data. The model's predictions closely align with the actual values, which is validated by a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set. This project highlights proficiency in time series analysis, LSTM network design, and data preparation for sequential models.
